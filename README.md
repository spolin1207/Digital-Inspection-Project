## Digital Inspection Project

This is the project I created the summer of 2021 during my internship at the Pacific Bearing Company. It's my first full-stack application where I designed the frontend (HTML/CSS), backend (Node.js), & database (SQL). I learned a lot over this internship and it took my development skills to the next level.

The Pacific Bearing Company is a manufacturing company, as such they manufacture thousands of different pieces of bearings, machinery, etc. all of which are subject to inspections. Initially, the inspections were all recorded on paper and filed away. However, the inspections contained large amounts of data that if analyzed, could power business decisions for the company. Defective manufacturing could be quickly identified, quality could be measured over time, all inspection data could be easily accessed and examined, etc.

The application I built was to help address that issue. It allowed the company to store all their inspection jobs, and even took it a step further by becoming a hub that contained all relevant information (pdfs, build instructions, 3D models) for all manufacturing jobs instead of merely an inspection database.

By the end of the summer, the project was successful and was being rolled out to departments within the company, with the goal being widespread adoption. Everything I worked on that summer is showcased within this project.
